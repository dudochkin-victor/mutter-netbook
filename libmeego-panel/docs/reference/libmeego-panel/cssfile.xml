    The appearance of the Toolbar button is controled using CSS style ID. Each
    panel needs to provide a css stylesheet with style definitions for the
    desired button appearance; it is possible to define multiple appearances
    with different IDs (e.g., the Power button would have different styles for
    full battery, empty battery, AC power, etc.).
  </para>

  <para>
    Apart from different style, the button can be in four different states
    differentiated by the associated pseudo style (normal, hover, active and
    checked state); a suitable style defintion needs to be provided for each of
    these for each style ID. (NB: As per the current Meego UI specficiation,
    the normal, active and checked styles are identical.)
  </para>

  <para>
    An example CSS definition for a single button state would looks as follows:

    <programlisting>
  MnbToolbarButton#mypanel-button-state1,
  MnbToolbarButton#mypanel-button-state1:active,
  MnbToolbarButton#mypanel-button-state1:checked
  {
    background-image: url("mypanel/mypanel-normal.png");
  }

  MnbToolbarButton#mypanel-button-state1:hover
  {
    background-image: url("mypanel/mypanel-hover.png");
  }
    </programlisting>
  </para>
