  <title>Meego Panel Overview</title>

    <para>
      Meego Panel is an application that inserts a button into the Meego
      Shell Toolbar, optionally associated with a drop-down panel shown when
      the users clicks on the button. The Panel controls the styling of the
      Toolbar button (provided by the Shell), and the associated tooltip. The
      drop down panel itself is a window provided by the Panel application.
    </para>

    <para>
      Communication between the Panel and the Toolbar is done over D-Bus: the
      Panel application is required to implement the <emphasis>
      org.meego.UX.Shell.Panel</emphasis>interface through which the Toolbar
      manipulates the Panel; libmeego-panel encapsulates implementation of this
      interface in the #MplPanelClient class, with subclasses for specific panel
      use-cases and toolkit choice #MplPanelClutter, #MplPanelGtk,
      #MplPanelWindowless. These classes mean that a panel application can be
      created with minimal development overhead.
    </para>

    <para>
      The position of a panel on the Toolbar is determined by a list stored
      in GConf under the key <filename>/desktop/meego/toolbar/panels/order
      </filename>; this can be altered by the user using the Toolbar settings
      applet.
    </para>

    <para>
      In general, panels are lazy-loaded by the Toolbar first time the user
      clicks the associated button. In order to facilitate this, each Panel
      must provide a desktop file containing the information necessary to
      construct the Toolbar button and to start the Panel.
